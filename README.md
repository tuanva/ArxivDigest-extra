## 🚀 Quick Start

Try it out on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/linhkid91/ArxivDigest-extra) using your own API keys.

## 🔍 What This Repo Does

Staying up to date on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) papers is time-consuming, with hundreds of new papers published daily. Even with the [official daily digest service](https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html), categories like [cs.AI](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent) still contain 50-100 papers per day.

This repository creates a personalized daily digest by:

1. **Crawling arXiv** for recent papers in your areas of interest
2. **Analyzing papers** in-depth using AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude)
3. **Two-stage processing** for efficiency:
   - Stage 1: Quick relevancy filtering using only title and abstract
   - Stage 2: Detailed analysis of papers that meet the relevancy threshold
4. **Scoring relevance** on a scale of 1-10 based on your research interests
5. **Providing detailed analysis** of each paper, including:
   - Key innovations
   - Critical analysis
   - Implementation details
   - Practical applications
   - Related work
6. **Generating reports** in HTML format with clean organization

## 🤖 Model Integrations

The system supports three major AI providers:

- **OpenAI GPT** (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)
- **Google Gemini** (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-2.0-flash)
- **Anthropic Claude** (claude-3-haiku, claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-opus, claude-3.5-sonnet)

You can use any combination of these models, allowing you to compare results or choose based on your needs.

## 📊 Output Formats

Reports are generated in multiple formats:

- **HTML Reports**: Clean, organized reports saved to the `/digest` directory with date-based filenames
- **Console Output**: Summary information displayed in the terminal
- **JSON Data**: Raw paper data saved to the `/data` directory

Every HTML report includes:
- Paper title, authors, and link to arXiv
- Relevancy score with explanation
- Abstract and key innovations
- Critical analysis and implementation details
- Experiments, results, and discussion points
- Related work and practical applications

Example HTML report:

## 💡 Setting Up and Usage

### Configuration

Modify `config.yaml` with your preferences:

```yaml
# Main research area
topic: "Computer Science"

# Specific categories to monitor
categories: ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computation and Language", "Machine Learning", "Information Retrieval"]

# Minimum relevance score (1-10)
threshold: 2

# Your research interests in natural language
interest: |
  1. AI alignment and AI safety
  2. Mechanistic interpretability and explainable AI
  3. Large language model optimization
  4. RAGs, Information retrieval
  5. AI Red teaming, deception and misalignment
```

## 🔧 Setting Up Virtual Environment

Before running the application, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To deactivate when you're done
# deactivate
```

**Why use a virtual environment?**
- Isolates project dependencies
- Prevents conflicts between different projects
- Makes it easier to manage package versions
- Ensures reproducibility across different machines

### Running the Web Interface

To run locally with the simplified UI:

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `python src/app_new.py` 
3. Open the URL displayed in your terminal
4. Enter your API key(s) and configure your preferences
5. Use the relevancy threshold slider to adjust paper filtering (default is 2)

### Running via GitHub Action

To set up automated daily digests:

1. Fork this repository
2. Update `config.yaml` with your preferences
3. Set the following secrets in your repository settings:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
4. The GitHub Action will run on schedule or can be triggered manually

### Running from Command Line

For advanced users:

```bash
# Regular paper digests with simplified UI
python src/app_new.py

# Design paper finder
./src/design/find_design_papers.sh --days 7 --analyze
```

## ⚠️ API Usage Notes

This tool respects arXiv's robots.txt and implements proper rate limiting. If you encounter 403 Forbidden errors:

1. Wait a few hours before trying again
2. Consider reducing the number of categories you're fetching
3. Increase the delay between requests in the code
